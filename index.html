          <h3>About Me</h3>
        <section id='About'>
        <p>I was originally born in Londrina, Brazil. I grew up in Queens, NY and then my family moved down to South Florida when I was around 7 years old. I have always had an interest in anything "techy". Coding has always been a skill that I knew I wanted to one day learn, so I decided to finally take the leap and sign up for a coding bootcamp.<br>
          <br>
        However, whenever I'm not studying I also enjoy:</p>
          <!-- I had to create a class for the lists because even though I was centering the text, the bullet points/numbers for the lists were staying on the left side -->
        <ol class="list-box">
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
        </ol>
          <p> I would love the chance to work with other developers and practice everything I've learned so far!</p>
